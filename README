Xarepo Micro Containers (MC)

This first pre-release contains only a small subset of it, but as unit
tests are completed and signed off during the coming months more
components will be added.

-------

This code is distributed under the ISC license which is a simplified
BSD license. This means that you can use this code basically any way
you want in both open source and commercial closed source projects,
just keep the copyright statements intact.

The twist with the ISC licence compared to the BSD license is that you
do not need to put credits in the documentation, which makes it easier
to include the code in any project.

For your convenience you may also choose the more well-known MIT
license if that suits your project better. For any other types of
licensing, contact us.

As usual there is no warranty.
