- The unit tests aims for 100% coverage, except for the
  abort()/assert() cases.
- Gcov is used to assess coverage.
- In some cases the .c file is included in the unit test code to
  provide access to static functions, which can make the gcov files
  look a bit confusing, but the coverage is there.
- Pseudorandom is used extensively, in some cases the number of
  iterations have been increased to make sure the all the pseudorandom
  combinations throughout the unit test reaches 100% code coverage.
- Pseudorandom is used to make the tests exactly repeatable.
